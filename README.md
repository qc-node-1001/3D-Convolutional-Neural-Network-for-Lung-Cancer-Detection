# 3D Convolutional Neural Network for Lung Cancer Detection

So I did some Medical Image Computing in my undergraduate engineering course and adored it! Since I'm interested in computer vision (and intelligence)
I wanted to see how AI, namely: deep learning can be applied in this Medical computer vision. Hence, motivated by some of the work done by
Nvidia as shown in GTC 2018 and deepmind medical research I wanted to apply 3D CNNs for cancer detection.

Therefore in this repository I apply 3D CNN for lung cancer detection on the Kaggle datascience bowl 2017 dataset:

The data is not that large! Hence, a good idea might be to combine other data sources such as LUNA16 and then run the 3D CNNs. Unfortunately,
I am limited to my memory space, computing power and time. Hence, running a large network on a huge dataset for me during my studies was difficult, however I hope you find this helpful.
